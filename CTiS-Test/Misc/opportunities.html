<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
	
	<h2 style="font-family:calibri;"> Opportunities of Cybersecurity in Counter Terrorism </h2>
	<pre style="font-family:calibri;"> 
	Furthering the cybersecurity field to battle terrorism is a smart decision to make and one that many countries are now pushing towards, 
	the early detection (anticipation) of the when and where terrorist attacks to be carried out will be located will be a major factor in counter terrorism 
	with the ability to prevent attacks before they start could potentially over time reduce the threat of terrorism to an all time low or even to nothing
	if the prevention of it gets the focus and budget that it needs.
	
	
	Bossong (2021). The particularly serious attacks in Paris in November 2015 marked a turning point in European counterterrorism policy. 
	Police and intelligence cooperation has been significantly intensified since then. In addition, 
	the EU decided to strengthen controls at its external borders and passed an ambitious reform package on biometric databases that can, 
	among other things, help identify suspected terrorists. Many of these measures have yet to be implemented on a technical level.
	In the current EU legislative period, however, the political focus has shifted. The latest joint EU Security Union Strategy, 
	published in summer 2020, addresses many aspects of the fight against terrorism, especially in the area of early detection or “anticipation” – 
	a new term in the EU’s discourse. However, according to this strategy, the most important priorities for the future are “hybrid threats,” 
	cybersecurity, the protection of critical infrastructures, and dealing with the impact of, as well as harnessing, 
	new technologies for security authorities (especially artificial intelligence and encryption). 
	Meanwhile, the Schengen zone and the freedom of movement must be preserved as much as possible during the ongoing pandemic.
	
	
	The European Union's decision to 'significantly intensify' the policy and the police and intelligence cooperation in spite of the recent spike 
	of terrorist attacks in the last decade has been a very smart move by the EU, as it has been very effective in preventing more recent attacks 
	and now are looking towards the future of terrorism in cyber hybrid threat terrorism which will be the most effective move to do 
	moving forward into a more technologically advancing world. 
	
	
	Bahgat (2020). In  January 2012, the Israel National Cyber Bureau (INCB) was established. 
	It was tasked with promoting and regulating government cyber activity; 
	improving cyber defense for the non-defense related sectors of the government; 
	and expanding the state's capabilities to secure critical infrastructure systems against cyber terrorism, 
	carried out both by foreign nations and by terrorist groups.
	
	This will result in higher opportunities to bring terrorism to a possible end and to prevent further attacks, 
	whether it be cyber or physical attacks the opportunity to stop it will arise with the changes being made to the use of
	cybersecurity in counter terrorism.
	</pre>

	<h2 style="font-family:calibri;"> Opportunities of Cybersecurity in Criminal Justice </h2>
	<pre style="font-family:calibri;"> 
	Lauterborn (2020). So, what will the future look like? 
	Law enforcement will inevitably catch up and one day we’ll be able to dial 911 and report cybercrimes, 
	the same as we would for any other type of crime. We are inching toward that future already, 
	with local law enforcement in places such as New York City and Atlanta 
	where the police departments are heavily invested in new technology and personnel around combating cybercrime.
	
	
	After researching more I discovered that the University of North Texas (UNT) stated that Dr. Belshaw, 
	who runs the UNT Cyber Forensics Technology Lab said “According to the FBI’s 2018 Internet Crime Complaint Center Internet Crime Report, 
	losses from cybercrime have more than doubled since 2017, This is a staggering statistic that exemplifies 
	the high demand for skilled investigators in cybersecurity.” Thus resulting in a push for more cybersecurity courses to be pushed
	into the criminal justice field thus resulting in being able to call the police for cyber crimes as we step forward into our 
	technologically advancing world and bring along with it more opportunities in terms of jobs and opportunities to reduce crime even further.
	
	</pre>
	
	<h2 style="font-family:calibri;"> Cybersecurity Budget </h2>
	<pre style="font-family:calibri;"> 
	Blitz (2021). In 2019, spending in the cybersecurity industry reached around 40.8 billion U.S. dollars, 
	with forecasts suggesting that the market will eclipse 54 billion U.S. dollars by 2021 as the best-case scenario, 
	taking into account the coronavirus (COVID-19) impact. 
	As many organizations around the world rely on cloud services to empower a remotely working workforce, 
	spending on cybersecurity is an important priority in order to ensure the protection of sensitive data, for example.
	
	
	The budget for cybersecurity increasing means the opportunities that come along with it can reach new levels resulting in not only a safer online world
	but a safer world in general due to the advances that can be made in criminal justice and in counter terrorism two of the highest threats we face as a people.
	
	<img src="../images/BudgetTable.jpg" alt="Budget Table"><br><br>
	
	As seen above in the graph we see the rise in the cybersecurity budget increasing from 34 billion in 2017 to 57.7 billion in 2021 
	an increase of 23.7 billion in just under 5 years.
	</pre>
	
	
	<pre style="font-family:calibri;">
	We have recently seen a rise in the need for cyber security and with that rise new opportunities will and have arised with it,
	we now face just the push forward into these opportunities to be carried out by the corresponsding orginisations.
	I strongly belive the opportunities in cybersecurity will be massively increased within the current decade resulting in more jobs,
	the ability to prevent and battle terrorism and the push to use cybersecurity in criminal justice to be able prevent cyber crime.
	Which I believe to be the better choices for budgeting as more coutries switch to a more cyber and digital presence in this world.
