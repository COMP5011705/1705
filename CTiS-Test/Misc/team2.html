<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>After researching on the topic at hand, I have learned a lot about cybersecurity. I have learnt it's significance<br>
	and how valuable it is with the rising threats of cyberattacks. With technology evolving every day and having <br>
	different uses and different purposes, if fallen into the wrong hands it could cause major damage. This research<br>
	has taught me how I can protect myself from such attacks and how to act if I ever to fall into one of these unfortunate<br>
	events. The same way I feel it is very beneficial for other to learn of the importance of cybersecurity and adopt it’s <br>
	values in their lives. Businesses would benefit greatly from implementing good cybersecurity practices. By having robust <br>
	firewalls and protocols and educating their colleagues on how to treat such attacks, they would benefit in the work rate and<br>
	efficiency at which work is done. At the same time all the advancements made can also be a downfall as I have reflected on <br>
	in my choices sections that AI is a strong defence against attacks, but if the same AI were accessed by someone intending to <br>
	threaten the company, they would have access to a lot of information. They could also alter this information to their benefit.<br>
	With cloud computing , people must be careful what they put up on the cloud and should also have good protection as this <br>
	valuable data can be accessed by skilled hackers. Out of all the topics I have spoken about, I agree with the fact that higher<br>
	education of cybersecurity needs to be implemented to the society and more importantly kids, as they are the future, and it is<br>
	always good to have them understand and see cybersecurity’s importance from a young age. This in turn would give us more people<br>
	applying for cybersecurity related jobs and in turn help society be more protected from cyber threats. </em></h4><br>
