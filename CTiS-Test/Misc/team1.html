<h1>Ethical Reflections Team Member 1 [Individual Page]</h1><br>

<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>
<t> I believe that companies, organizations, and governments need to be vigilant with cybersecurity and 
	the risks that come with an increasingly digitalised world. These entities need to place the privacy of 
	the individualâ€™s information that they possess, above their reputation. I believe that there also needs 
	to be an active approach to the creation of security platforms that plan for a security breach rather 
	than the common approach of reacting to these breaches. To do this I think that the powerful 
	entities need to invest in constant research into the risks of cybersecurity, so that professionals in 
	cybersecurity will have a larger understanding of the risk that they need to plan for, and so the 
	research is not outdated compared to the rapid evolution that is seen in the digital ecosystem.
