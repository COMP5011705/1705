<h1 style="font-family:calibri;">Cybersecurity Choices</h1>
<pre style="font-family:calibri;">
Cybersecurity is very important in our day-to-day developing world, with all the valuable data 
that needs to be kept safeguarded from malicious hackers/agencies that could use this 
information for the wrong reasons. On this page we will be discussing the different choices 
that could be made with cybersecurity and how these choices could impact our future.
</pre>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Should companies invest in Cybersecurity?</h2>
<pre style="font-family:calibri;">
Cybersecurity offers a lot of protection to us and acts as a safe blanket from dangerous malware. 
With cybersecurity we could see a lot of good happening in the digital department. The productivity 
would increase exponentially with no hiccups in terms of break-ins from viruses trying to corrupt 
the system. With the recent pandemic many businesses put brakes on their defence systems, which led 
to their data being vulnerable to the public. Covid affected a lot of components in the digital world. 
Many company’s having to move their data around , which could lead to openings for hackers and viruses. 
Not only that but after the pandemic is over , we are still in need of remote services , and hence it 
is important to have good cybersecurity(Security, P. 2021, April 22).
</pre>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Should Cybersecurity take an AI approach?</h2>
<pre style="font-family:calibri;">
Artificial intelligence is one of the leading choices many companies are planning to take to make
sure cybersecurity is more refined and robust. With AI , the manpower would significantly decrease 
as the simple viruses or breaches could be dealt by automated technology as there is a certain 
plan of action for it. Leaving the more complexed and notorious breaches to us. Using AI would 
also allow us to spend our time and energy on other tasks and to improve the defence system and 
make sure the AI is robust and up to date.
 
But this can be a double-edged sword, as AI keeps evolving and getting better at keeping viruses 
out, there are several criminal networks that use AI in their work to get into industries systems.
As companies develop AI and use new techniques, hackers and criminal networks adapt from these 
defence mechanisms and build an even stronger attack to get a hold of data. If AI is to go on the 
trajectory it is at, it could be very dangerous for us in the long run if people with malicious 
or ill intent were able to hack/bypass these protocols and defences businesses have put in place
(Security, P. 2021, April 22). 

The main takeaway is that Artificial Intelligence is a very essential choice that could benefit 
cybersecurity around the world given that extra care is taken in making sure there are good 
firewalls and defences kept making sure hackers cannot bypass the cybersecurity offered by AI.

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Future of Cybersecurity with Cloud storage:</h2>
<pre style="font-family:calibri;">
Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources 
include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software
(Frankenfield, J. 2020, July 28). One main application of cloud computing is cloud storage. 
With the development of technology and the various issues we face in our day-to-day life, cloud 
storage is very essential as it for storing data without having to have hardware connected and 
all of this can be done comfortably from home, making it more practical for pandemics and 
similar life crisis. 

Cloud storage has various advantages, it reduces the cost by making everything digital, so the
businesses don’t have to buy hard disks or spaces to store the storage. Monitoring costs could 
also be saved if everything is stored digitally. Data can also be very redundant , with how much 
of it could be repeated or sent over a few times. Cloud storage could fix this problem by not 
storing redundant data and save space for other valuable data. At the same time, it could also 
be used to replicate data if needed , instead of having to copy data manually, we could use 
software and cloud storage to replicate this data to be used later on
(Blogger, C. L. G. 2018, March 8).

 At the same time , having cloud storage could open a lot of vulnerability. Due to the pandemic,
a lot of businesses moved to cloud storage. During this move, a lot of the data is open to the 
public and with a lot of rising malicious criminal organisations, they could have access to all 
this information. Without proper firewalls and safe protocols applied to the security of this data 
it could be very vulnerable to a lot of the public. If cloud storage is to be used in the future, 
it would have to be used with proper safeguarding of the information so hackers and malware can’t 
affect it.

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Should higher education be implemented for the future of Cybersecurity? </h2>
<pre style="font-family:calibri;">
Even though the education of cybersecurity has  been fairly recognized in the last decade, it 
still isn’t enough with the variety of cyberattacks and their different threat levels. People 
need to learn more about cybersecurity to have knowledge on what to do if they were to be in such 
and unfortunate situation where their data and information is at threat.

If schools were to add cybersecurity-based courses , even if it were to be of low skill level,
it would be a good start to get people educated on cybersecurity and cyberattacks. The interest
in cybersecurity would increase as more kids would have knowledge of it and would apply to 
cybersecurity related jobs, which would give society more people protecting us from cyberattacks. 
Even at school level, this would serve as general knowledge to equip students to know more and have 
protocols on how to deal with attacks. 
 
A lot of businesses need to have protocols and have their employees know about these protocols in 
an event of a breach from the outside world. Educating staff on these protocols could keep them 
prepared and in turn minimise on risks. As Enzo Brienza from Infosecurity states, they could back 
up data offline from time to time and have regular checks to see if any breaches have been made
(Brienza, E. 2021, February 2).

Out of all the choices that have been talked about, I personally feel like higher education in 
cybersecurity needs to be implemented so that the public are well educated on how to act and what 
to do when a cyberattack were to happen. This would give us a decent defence against cybercriminal 
agencies and cyberattacks in future battles.
